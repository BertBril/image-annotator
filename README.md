This tool allows you to annotate a collection of images with measures.

You could do this using your favorite 'Paint' tool, but if you have to make a lot of these on the same images, then this tool can be handy.

The idea is to set up everything in config.json, start the app, fill in the measures, se howit looks, then save the new annotated picture.

Included example config and images are use case with garments.

It really is small and easy.
It's Python, you'll need pyqt6 and pillow. There is a Windows executable in 'Actions' (but you shouldn't really use Windows, it sucks).

Useful in 2025, maybe 2026. After that you just explain your AI and he'll do it for you on-the-fly.
Made with help from ChatGPT 4o, but I had to steer quite a bit. Cost me a few hours.

Enjoy!
